Hi, my name is Enrico and I work in IT since 2002. I'm a systems engineer and technical consultant specializing in modern workplace solutions and enterprise infrastructure. My expertise centers on designing, implementing, and managing virtual desktop environments and cloud-based productivity platforms.

Over the years, I've developed deep technical knowledge in desktop virtualisation technologies, with a particular focus on Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365 and Citrix CVAD. My work primarily involves the Microsoft ecosystem, including Azure cloud services, Microsoft Intune, Entra ID and Microsoft 365.

Hopefully, you'll find some useful information on my blog :-)
